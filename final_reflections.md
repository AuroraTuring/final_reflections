1. As you look back on your time in Mod 0, what are you most proud of?
I'm proud of the speed at which I did the conditionals assignments.

2. What did you learn about yourself, as a person or a student, during Mod 0?
I need different and new ways to study besides just flashcards and repeated reading. 

3. What is one thing you want to remember as you start this new journey to become a software developer at Turing?
I want to remember that even when it gets hard, the reward is great, and it will enable me to get my dog back, which is what I most look forward to! 

4. Finally, share some gratitude for the people who were most supportive to you throughout this Mod 0 experience!
I'm thankful for my partner Mika and my roommate Viki who are both in coding. They've been helping with my assignments when I get stuck.
